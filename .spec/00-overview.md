# Portfolio Website – Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website used as the primary public
representation of my engineering profile.

The site is intended for:
- recruiters
- hiring managers
- technical peers

Primary goals:
- communicate engineering focus and maturity
- showcase selected projects with live demos
- act as a stable hub linking to GitHub and deployed apps

This is not a blog, CMS, or content-heavy site.
