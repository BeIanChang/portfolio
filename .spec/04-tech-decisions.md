# Tech Decisions

## Next.js
Chosen for recruiter familiarity and static export support.

## Tailwind CSS
Chosen for fast iteration and consistency during vibe coding.

## Netlify
Chosen for:
- zero-config CI/CD
- preview deployments
- static hosting

## No GitHub Actions
Netlify build pipeline is sufficient for this project.
